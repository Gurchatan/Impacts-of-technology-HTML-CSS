                                 <p> <b>Positives of computers in the workforce</b><br>
                                     The widespread use of computers in the workforce has brought about numerous benefits,
                                     revolutionizing productivity and efficiency. 
                                     By automating repetitive tasks and streamlining workflows, 
                                     computers have significantly reduced manual labor and time-consuming processes. 
                                     They enable workers to perform complex calculations, analyze data, 
                                     and generate accurate reports with unprecedented speed and accuracy. Moreover, 
                                     computers facilitate seamless communication and collaboration among team members, regardless of their geographical locations. 
                                     They provide instant access to vast amounts of information, 
                                     empowering employees to make informed decisions and stay updated on industry trends.<br>
                                     <b>Negatives of computers in the workforce</b><br>
                                    While computers have brought about numerous benefits in the workforce, 
                                    there are also some negatives associated with their use.
                                     One major concern is the potential for job displacement. 
                                     As automation and artificial intelligence continue to advance, 
                                     certain tasks and roles that were once performed by humans are becoming automated, 
                                     leading to job losses in some sectors. Additionally, 
                                     heavy reliance on computers can lead to issues such as technological glitches and system failures,
                                      which can disrupt operations and cause significant downtime. Moreover, 
                                      the constant exposure to screens and sedentary nature of computer-based work can have adverse health effects, 
                                      including eye strain, musculoskeletal disorders, and a sedentary lifestyle. Another challenge is the need for continuous training and upskilling to keep up with rapidly evolving technologies, 
                                      which can be both time-consuming and costly for organizations. <br>
